  "arguments": {},
  "solution": "A tick on your server took an exceedingly long time to process\nFurther explanation: Minecraft updates the server (i.e the positions of players, mob AI, etc.) 20 times per second. This means that, on average, a tick (an update of the server) should take less than 50ms to complete. This message appears when a tick takes much longer than 50ms to complete.\nSolution: If your server is running fine, this warning can be safely ignored. If you are consistently seeing this warning and the server is clearly lagging, try using a profiler such as [Spark](https://spark.lucko.me/) to investigate why your server is performing poorly. If you aren't already, try running your server on [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/), which contains many optimizations that will make your server run faster."
