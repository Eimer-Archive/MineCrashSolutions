Try changing the `server-port=` value in the `server.properties` file.\nFor Linux users, you can see what ports are in use and by what programs by running `netstat -ltp` as root. Then, you can kill the process using the port your Minecraft server is attempting to use by running `kill -9 [PID]`.\nIf all else fails, try rebooting your computer."
